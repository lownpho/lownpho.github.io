      <h1>Risks of licking eyeballs</h1>
      <p><em class="article-date">April 7, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Licking eyeballs is a bizarre and potentially <strong>dangerous</strong> practice that
        has gained some attention in recent years. While it may seem like a
        harmless act, there are several <strong>risks</strong> associated with licking eyeballs
        that should be considered before engaging in this unusual behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the primary risks of licking eyeballs is the potential for
        transmitting <strong>bacteria</strong> and <strong>viruses</strong>. The human mouth is home to a variety
        of <strong>microorganisms</strong>, some of which can cause <strong>infections</strong> if they come into
        contact with the delicate tissues of the eye. This can lead to
        conditions such as <strong>conjunctivitis</strong>, <strong>keratitis</strong>, or even more serious eye
        infections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, licking eyeballs can cause <strong>physical damage</strong> to the eye. The
        tongue is not a <strong>sterile</strong> instrument, and the act of licking can introduce
        foreign particles or <strong>irritants</strong> into the eye, leading to discomfort or
        injury. Furthermore, the moisture from saliva can disrupt the natural
        <strong>tear film</strong>, causing <strong>dryness</strong> and irritation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another concern is the potential for <strong>allergic reactions</strong>. Some
        individuals may be allergic to certain <strong>proteins</strong> or substances found in
        saliva, which can trigger an allergic response when they come into
        contact with the eye. This can result in symptoms such as <strong>redness</strong>,
        <strong>swelling</strong>, and <strong>itching</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Someone once died</h2>
      <p>
        In 2013, a young man from Cork died due to complications arising from
        his girlfriend licking his eyeball, a practice that led to a severe
        <strong>bacterial infection</strong>. The infection spread rapidly, causing permanent
        damage to his <strong>cornea</strong> and eventually leading to <strong>sepsis</strong>. This tragic
        incident serves as a stark reminder of the serious <strong>consequences</strong> that can
        result from engaging in such risky behavior. Medical professionals
        strongly advise against any contact between the <strong>mouth</strong> and <strong>eyes</strong> to
        prevent similar tragedies.
